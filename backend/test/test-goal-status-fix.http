### Test Goal Status Update Issue Fix
### Step 1: Login to get authentication token
POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@test.com",
  "password": "admin123"
}

###
### Step 2: Get all goals to find a goal ID
GET http://localhost:3000/goals
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

###
### Step 3: Try updating a goal status (this should now work without errors)
PATCH http://localhost:3000/goals/GOAL_ID_HERE
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "in-progress"
}

###
### Step 4: Test with just status update using the dedicated endpoint
PATCH http://localhost:3000/goals/GOAL_ID_HERE/status
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "completed"
}

###
### Step 5: Verify the goal was updated
GET http://localhost:3000/goals/GOAL_ID_HERE
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
